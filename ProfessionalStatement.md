My name is Jamie Turner and I am passionate about information security and cybersecurity. I enjoy contributing to solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves.  Within my current organization, I rely on my strong collaboration and problem-solving skills to meet goals.  I also strive to communicate effectively across various levels of the organization.

In my current role as a system security and software administrator, I value protecting others information, protecting the security of the system, and helping others realize their full potential.  My primary duties are generating log reports, safeguarding software and flash drives, verifying incremental backups, creating weekly backups, and analyzing log reports.

Though I am new to the field, my twenty years of work experience in the aviation and electronics fields have given me real world experiences that can be applied to any organization.  I am passionate about learning new information in cybersecurity through social media and podcasts.  I plan to be known for my ability to share information with my peers and collaborate with different departments and teams to find solutions.  I obtained the CompTIA Security Plus CE in April 2023 and am currently gaining practical skills with the Google Cybersecurity Certificate course.
